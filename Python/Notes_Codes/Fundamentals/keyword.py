    # What are keywords ?
    # keywords are also known as data types  :- wrong statement

    # Keyword :- Keywords are predefined and reserved words in Python
    # Each keyword has a specific meaning and purpose in the language

    # int, float, char (no char type in Python), double (Python float), bool :- fits right as concepts
    # for, return, if, else, match (3.10+), case, break, continue, pass etc.. :- keywords

    # can i create a integer variable named as 'for'? :- No because 'for' is a keyword
    my_char = 'a'
    print(my_char)
