    // Keyword :- Keywords are predefined and reserved words in cpp 
    // Each keyword has a specific meaning and purpose in the language  

    // int, float, char, double, bool  :- it fits right 
    // for, return, if, else, switch, case, break, continue, goto etc.. :- it fits wrong

    //can i create a integer variable named as char ? :- No because char is a keyword 
    char my_char = 'a'; 
    cout<<my_char<<endl;
